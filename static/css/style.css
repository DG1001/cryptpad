This file is intentionally left blank as styles are now primarily managed by Tailwind CSS via CDN.
You can add custom global styles here if needed, or styles for elements not easily targeted by Tailwind utilities.
For example:
body {
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
